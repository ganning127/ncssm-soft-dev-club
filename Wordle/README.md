# Wordle üìù
Created wordle using Node.js. This was a command prompt based game.

### Next Steps
- There's a bug in our code! If the word to guess was `molar`, and we guessed `hello`, the first `l` would be marked green, but the second `l` would be marked yellow. In actual wordle, only the first `l` is marked green, and the second `l` is marked the default color (dark gray).
- Make this game work with varying lengths of words!
